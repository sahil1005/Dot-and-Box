This is an implementation of the game Dots and Boxes.
This is my Final Year Project implementation.

To play the game, use the command '>python DotsAndBoxes' at the command line.

This launches a simple GUI that allows you to pick the board size you want, and allows you to play the game by clicking on the line you want to draw.

To run unit tests, use command '>python -m unittest -b'
